# Fraction Genome Altered
FGA was calculated per sample as the fraction of the genome with absolute log2 copy ratios > 0.2. These were added to `calculated_TMB_and_FGA.csv` as a column `Our_FGA`. Log2 copy ratio is found as column `seg.mean` in [data_cna_hg19.seg](https://github.com/TomMakesThings/Genomics-II-Group/blob/main/Data/data_cna_hg19.seg).
