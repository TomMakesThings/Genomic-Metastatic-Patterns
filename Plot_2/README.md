# Notes to answer Kate's question:

### "This is targeted/panel sequencing data. You need to think about how this effects your calculations vs. if it was whole-genome or whole-exome data."
**Paper:** Harmonization of Tumor Mutational Burden Quantification and Association With Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Nonâ€“Small-Cell Lung Cancer
* TMB values were higher in the panel cohorts than in the whole-exome sequencing (WES) cohort. Subsetting the WES cohort by gene panels only partially reproduced the observed differences in TMB.
