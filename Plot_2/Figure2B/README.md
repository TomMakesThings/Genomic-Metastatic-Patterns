# Significance
Significance between primary and metastasis samples for FGA, WGD, TMB and TMB was quantified using the Mann-Whitney U test (`significant_subtypes.csv`).
q-values were calculated by adjusting p-values for false discovery rate and a q-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
