# Significance
Significance between primary and metastasis samples for FGA, WGD, TMB and TMB was quantified using the Mann-Whitney U test (`significant_subtypes.csv`). Q-values were calculated by adjusting p-values for false discovery rate and a q-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

# TMB High and WGD
The fraction of samples per subtype for primary and metastatic samples with a tumor mutational burden >= 10 mutations per megabase was calculated. This was combined with WGD and number of patients in file `tmb_high_and_wgd.csv`.
