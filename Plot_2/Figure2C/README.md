# Statistically Significant Oncogenic Alterations
Alterations, consisting of mutations, amplifications, deletions and fusions, were considered oncogenic if labelled as "Oncogenic" or "Likely oncogenic" by OncoKB. The frequency of each oncogenic alteration per subtype for primary and metastasis was calculated as the fraction of samples with the alteration, divided by the number of samples in the sub- and sample type. Oncogenic alterations were considered recurrent by checking if either their primary or metastatic frequency was > 5%. Then they were filtered further and considered significant if they had q-value < 0.05 calculated from the Mann Whitney U test.
