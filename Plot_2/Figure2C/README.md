# Statistically Significant Oncogenic Alterations
Alterations, consisting of mutations, amplifications, deletions and fusions, were considered oncogenic if labelled as "Oncogenic" or "Likely oncogenic" by OncoKB. The frequency of each gene alteration per subtype for primary and metastasis was calculated as the fraction of samples with the alteration, divided by the number of all samples in the subtype and sample type.
